    <div class= "chart-text"> Market disruptor Airbnb has a large presence in New York City and is causing conflict among legislators, community residents and those who use the platform to make ends meet. This project looks into the rent premium created by the difference between average Airbnb prices of entire homes throughout New York City and average market rate rents, compared to poverty rates in four boroughs. </div>

    <div class= "chart-text"> This shows the location of each entire home  Airbnb listing in Manhattan. With 24,334 total listings in New York City, housing units listed on Airbnb comprises 0.714% of the New York City housing stock. Within the five boroughs, 58.97% of the listings are in Manhattan, 36.65% are in Brooklyn, 4.02% are in Queens, .22% are in Staten and .14% of listings are located in the Bronx. In Manhattan, listings are higher in the neighborhoods of the East and West Villages and Midtown, while in Brooklyn the highest concentration of listings is in Williamsburg and in Queens most listings are in Astoria. </div>

    <div class= "chart-text"> Bronx: The Bronx has the highest poverty rate out of the five boroughs in New York City, nearly ten percent higher than the rest of the city at 30%. Of the 289 listings, census tracts with higher poverty rates had slightly higher Airbnb premiums, however there were many outliers. The highest Airbnb premium in the Bronx has a 18.57% rent premium, which is located in a census tract with a 20% poverty rate. Other units with 14.36% and 8.11% rent premiums were in census tracts with 23% and 26% of the population living in poverty. The unit in a tract with the highest poverty rate, 58.50%, had a 6.16% rent premium and 30 units were in tracts that had over a 30% poverty rate. Over 30% of the Airbnb units located in the Bronx were in census tracts that had over 30% of the population living in poverty.</div>

    <div class = "chart-text"> Brooklyn: We can see that more units are concentrated in the lower left hand side of the graph, revealing a lower poverty rate generally in this borough compared with the Bronx. It is also clear that there are more units with high rent premiums in Brooklyn than the Bronx, although the highest rent premium was lower than in the Bronx at 17.42%. In the Bronx, only two units has rent premiums higher than 10%, and 6 units with rent premiums higher than 5%, while in Brooklyn there were 19 units with premiums over 5% and 8 of these units had premiums over 10%. The highest poverty rate in the Brooklyn tracts with Airbnb units was 57.83%, for a unit with a 3.63% rent premium. Forty eight of the units in Brooklyn were located in census tracts with over a 30% poverty rate, which equates to 11.26% of the Brooklyn listings. </div>

    <div class = "chart-text"> Queens: In Queens, less of the population is living in poverty, with 3% of the units in census tracts with over 30% poverty. Compared to Manhattan, Queens shows less of a correlation between increasing poverty rates and rental premiums, with units in lower poverty areas having many of the highest premiums, suggesting a high amount of profit for wealthier Airbnb hosts. The highest premium in Queens is 12.45%, a unit in a tract with 4% poverty. Tracts with a rental premium exceeding 5% comprised 6% of the listings in Queens, and the average poverty rate for these listings was 14.8%, lower than what can be seen in other boroughs in the city.</div>

    <div class = "chart-text"> Manhattan: Manhattan had the highest rent premium of any borough at 19.46%, a unit in a tract with a poverty rate of 21%. Twenty seven of the listings had a rent premium over 5%, while 13% of the listings were in census tracts with over 30% poverty rate. Manhattan had the third highest poverty rate following the Bronx and Brooklyn, at 50.6%, where a unit had a rent premium of 7.76%. Generally, we can see that as the poverty rate increases, the rent premiums also rise, potentially indicating that those living in higher poverty are utilizing Airbnb to cover the cost of their apartments.</div>
